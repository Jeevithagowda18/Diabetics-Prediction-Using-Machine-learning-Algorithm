# Diabetics-Prediction-Using-Machine-learning-Algorithm
This project develops a Diabetes Detection System using AI and machine learning to predict diabetes risk based on health metrics like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and age. By applying advanced algorithms, it identifies high-risk individuals early, supporting timely intervention and improving preventive healthcare.
